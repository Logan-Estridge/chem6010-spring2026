# Datasets Autocorrelation 

This folder contains four datasets with time series sampled from four different models. 
- All the models have the same mean and should have very similar standard deviations.
- For two of the models, there is no correlation between data points.
- For the other two models, the data points are correlated to a certain degree but differ in the correlation.

To practice, you should perform the following tasks for the different datasets:
- Visualize and plot the time series.
- Estimate the densities using histogramming or kernel density estimation.
- Calculate the average (i.e., mean) and standard deviation. 
- Calculate and plot the autocorrelation function.
- Use block averaging to estimate the standard error of the mean.
- Based on your results, what can you deduce about the different models?
  - Which of them has uncorrelated data points?
  - What can you determine about the difference between the two models with uncorrelated data points?
  - Which one of the models has the longest autocorrelation time?
